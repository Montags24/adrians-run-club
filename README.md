# Adrian's Run Club

## Aim
As a keen runner, I am always looking out for deals on new shoes, especially ones used for racing as they wear out quite quickly. The main site I use to look up deals is RunRepeat, which allows you to filter by shoe, size and type (trail, road, track etc). The site however doesn't alert you to deals, so it is down to you to go onto the site regularly to see if the shoe is on sale. 

Adrian's Run Club will scrape the website RunRepeat for its competitive shoes and store the data in a database. The site will allow users to select shoes and sizes to get email alerts when they go on sale.

## Technologies used:
- Bootstrap v5.0 to create the front-end of the web using HTML and CSS
- Python v3.11 with the Flask framework for the back-end
- SQLite for storing data in a database
- Git for version control
- Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape data from RunRepeat
